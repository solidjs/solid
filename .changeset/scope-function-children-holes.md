Scope-wrap bare function children in hydratable mode. A function child (`<main>{() => <App/>}</main>`, including via the `children` attribute) is a deferred hole at runtime, but it never classified as `dynamic`, so neither generate reserved an id scope for it — its owner ids drifted across async retry passes on the server and desynced from the client (the #2900 hydration-id-parity class). Both compilers now treat syntactic function expressions as scope-eligible alongside dynamic values, emitting `_$scope(...)` in the ssr generate and around the matching insert accessor in the dom generate. The native compiler also unwraps TS casts in the allocate-ids predicate, matching Babel (fixes a scope-emission desync for `{call() as any}` children).
