# @solidjs/babel-plugin

## 2.0.0-rc.3

### Minor Changes

- 89a0531: Absorb the 0.50 expressions snapshot into this repo: lift compilers as `@solidjs/babel-plugin` and `@solidjs/compiler`, dump runtimes into `@solidjs/web` / `h` / `html` / `universal`. Origin: ryansolid/dom-expressions@e97e4290 (0.50.0-next.44).
- 89a0531: Collapse the expressions dump: drop the rxcore seam, flatten runtimes into package `src/`, delete `babel-preset-solid`, and publish compiler natives as `@solidjs/compiler-*`.

### Patch Changes

- 47a797e: Drop leftover DOM Expressions loader fallbacks and reframe the compiler and Babel plugin as Solid 2.0 packages. Node `transform()` now defaults `moduleName` to `@solidjs/web` and `builtIns` to the Solid control-flow set, matching `@solidjs/babel-plugin`. SSR leaves a sole component child unescaped (it is a value; the callee's insert sites escape) and only HTML-escapes mixed/fragment children and element holes. Local native builds remain usable when an in-repo platform-package stub has not been populated yet.
- 0d2810a: Fix Babel and native compiler lowering divergences around nested content, custom-element ownership, static attributes, namespaces, and conditional evaluation order.

The Babel compiler implementation joined the SolidJS 2.0 monorepo at `2.0.0-rc.2` under the temporary `@solidjs/babel-plugin-jsx` name. It adopted this syntax-neutral package name before the integration merged. Earlier releases lived in [DOM Expressions](https://github.com/ryansolid/dom-expressions).
