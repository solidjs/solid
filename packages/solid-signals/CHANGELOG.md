### Patch Changes

- 34c65b8: CSR: async reads without a `Loading` ancestor no longer throw. The root mount now participates in transitions — when uncaught async surfaces during initial render, the root DOM attach is withheld until all pending settles and then attaches atomically. On the no-async happy path, `render()` still attaches synchronously before returning (via an internal tail `flush()`).

  **New `schedule` option on effects**

  `@solidjs/signals` exposes a new `schedule?: boolean` option on `EffectOptions`. When `true`, the initial effect callback is enqueued through the effect queue (the same path user effects already take) instead of running synchronously at creation. This lets the initial run participate in transitions — if any source bails during the compute phase, the callback is held until the transition settles.

  ```ts
  createRenderEffect(
    () => source(),
    v => {
      /* runs after flush, deferred by any pending transition */
    },
    { schedule: true }
  );
  ```

  `@solidjs/web`'s `render()` uses this option internally for its top-level insert, which is what enables permissive top-level async in CSR.

  **Dev diagnostic**

  `ASYNC_OUTSIDE_LOADING_BOUNDARY` is now a non-halting `console.warn` (severity downgraded from `error` to `warn`). With deferred-mount the runtime is correct; the diagnostic is an informative FYI rather than a correctness failure. The warning only fires during the synchronous body of `render()` / `hydrate()` — post-mount transitions (including lazy route changes) run under their own transitions with the guard off and do not emit this warning.

  Placing a `Loading` boundary remains the right tool when you want explicit fallback UI or partial progressive mount.

  **Known limitation: multi-phase async**

  Multi-phase async flows — for example, a `lazy()` component whose resolved body reads a second pending async memo — may still reveal partial DOM between waves. This is because the scheduler currently nulls `activeTransition` before running the completing flush's restored queues; a new transition started by recomputes during that phase does not re-stash already-restored callbacks. Single-wave nested async (including static siblings alongside a pending descendant) commits atomically. The multi-phase case is tracked as a follow-up; the recommended workaround today is to place a `Loading` boundary around multi-phase async subtrees.
